# BootScript

BootScript is a high-level, transpiled programming language made to be compatible with old web browsers.  
BootScript is designed as a modded subset of ECMA-262 first edition (based on JavaScript 1.1) with two key additions:

1. **Macros for Code Generation**  
  BootScript allows developers to define macros that alter your code at transpile time.

2. **Automatic Polyfills**  
  BootScript automatically inserts polyfills for modern browser APIs when needed.

All BootScript programs are compiled to a version of JavaScript that can run in every standardized browser starting from Netscape 2.0 without runtime errors.
